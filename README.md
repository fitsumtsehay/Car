Create a class called Car. 
The Car class should inherit from the Vehicle class.
Car should contain the following:
private member variables
a default constructor
an overloaded constructor
methods which return a string indicating each task the car is performing.
Create another class called CarApp which contains the main method. In the main method create an instance of a Car.
Then print the output of the different methods as the car object is "operated".
